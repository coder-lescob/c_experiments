# My C experiments

This repository contains a lot of my C experiments like linkedlists. I did this repository to summerize all of usful things that I can do in C, for later usage.
In this repo you can find functions from <u>The C programming language<u> by Brian W.KERNICHAN and Dennis M.RITCHIE, or my answers to the differents exercices
of this amazing book.

# Experiments yet
* --linkedlist : a list of linked element usful in some usage, but to slow for others.
* --binarysearch : find a substring in an input.
